Old fork of Jack-mixer adding the functionality to "bridge" System Outputs. 

You get a mixer channel (mono/stereo) for everything connected to a system_output, so you can comfortably control/mute everything that goes to a device. 


jack_mixer -- Jack Audio Mixer
==============================

jack_mixer is a GTK+ JACK audio mixer app with look similar to its hardware
counterpart.  It has lot of useful features, apart from being able to mix
multiple JACK audio streams.

It is licensed under GPL version 2 (or later), check COPYING for more info.

Please visit project homepage is at http://home.gna.org/jackmixer/ for more
info.

This Repo is a fork with one additional functionality implemented
"Bridge System Playback" interferes each connection to a physical playback
with an intermediate Mixer Track. 

Installation
------------

Read INSTALL for information on installation.


Using MIDI CCs to control jack_mixer
------------------------------------

MIDI CCs can be used to control volume and balance/panorama of channels.

The default controller for main channel volume is 7, and the default for
main channel balance is 8.  Default controllers for added channels are
chosen using predefined algorithm, first free controller starting from 11,
first for volume, next for balance/panorama.

So, if you don't delete channels, you will get CC#11 used for first input
channel volume, CC#12 for first channel balance/panorama, CC#13 for second
channel volume, CC#14 for second channel balance/panorama, etc.

It is also possible to select other CCs when creating the channel, or
afterwards from the channel properties dialog (accessible by double clicking
on the channel name).

MIDI CC values (0-127) are mapped to dBFS using current slider scale for
corresponding channel.
